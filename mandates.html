        Linked Decisions as Linked Data (lblod) is a project for an interoperable ecosystem of local decisions. A project in 2016 carried out by <a href="http://iminds.be" target="_blank">iMinds</a> created a proof of concept in co-creation with local authorities in Flanders, the regional government of Flanders, and different service providers. The result of the proof of concept contain, but are not limited to, this vocabulary, a proof of concept of a Linked Data authoring environment, a server harvesting local decisions using <a href="http://thedatatank.com" target="_blank">The DataTank</a>, a search interface through the harvested data and a persistent URI creator.

        This document is part of a proof of concept and will not be under active development after June 2016. It is up to future projects to extend the results of this proof of concept into a maintained vocabulary.
        Furthermore, the URIs are not dereferencable at this point. At the time of writing, the Flemish URI strategy 2.0 was not yet voted, yet we took into account a draft from June 2016 when creating the URIs.

      <h2>The Mandates schema</h2>
      <p>
        Only a few URIs are defined within the mandates namespace.
        This schema provides an overview of the to be used URIs when linking the data together.
      </p>
      <h3>Explanation</h3>
      <p>
        A Mandate belongs to a Person and vice versa.
        It declares the period of time a person has a certain MandateType in a certain foaf:Organization.
        Both foaf:Organization or schema:Organization may be used to describe the organization.
        The organization, for instance a local council, also defines a mandate taxonomy (via the property mandatesTaxonomy).
        This mandate taxonomy is a skos:ConceptScheme, with in the scheme skos:Concepts such as a Mayor, Chair Man, Secretary, etc.
        The element from this mandate taxonomy is linked to a Mandate through the mandateType property.
        A mandate is to be created by a lbld:Decision, which can be linked back to the decision through the prov:wasGeneratedBy property from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/" target="_blank">Prov-O ontology</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dcterms:topic is a list of terms that denote the topic of the mandate. There is no official legal explanation for this, yet in the real world, a deputy mostly has certain responsibilities, such as "mobility" or "public works".
        A mandate also has a startDate and an endDate. The endDate is not known at the time when the mandate is created, yet a planned endDate can be deducted from the length of the current term. The endDate is however to be left empty until the Mandate ended in reality, which may happen because of a new term, but also because of unforeseen circumstances.
