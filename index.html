        Linked Decisions as Linked Data (lblod) is a project for an interoperable ecosystem of local decisions. A project in 2016 carried out by <a href="http://iminds.be" target="_blank">iMinds</a> created a proof of concept in co-creation with local authorities in Flanders, the regional government of Flanders, and different service providers. The result of the proof of concept contain, but are not limited to, this vocabulary, a proof of concept of a Linked Data authoring environment, a server harvesting local decisions using <a href="http://thedatatank.com" target="_blank">The DataTank</a>, a search interface through the harvested data and a persistent URI creator.

        This document is part of a proof of concept and will not be under active development after June 2016. It is up to future projects to extend the results of this proof of concept into a maintained vocabulary.
